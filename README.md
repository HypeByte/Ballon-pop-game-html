# Ballon-pop-game-html
Made using SVG graphics, html, css, and js. A game I made when I was 10 yrs old. The graphics are very good, and it is a 2d game. Balloons drop from the sky and you must go under them before they hit the ground.
To play the game, open up your terminal (cmd), do git clone and then the url, and then you must locate the PlayHere.htm file. You can go ahead and double click on PlayHere to start the game. It will open up on your web browser.
