# Ballon-pop-game-html
Made using SVG graphics, html, css, and js. Pretty garbage game, but please remember I was only ten when I made this. The graphics are very good, and it is a 2d game. Balloons drop from the sky and you must go under them before they hit the ground.
For: The people, companies, and colleges.
NO STEALING MY CODE UNLESS YOU GIVE CREDITS TO ME
To play the game, do git clone and then the url, and then you must locate the PlayHere.htm. You can go ahead and double click on PlayHere to start the game. It will open up on your web browser. I am sorry if it looks really ugly (the code), I was only 10 when writting the code and didn't have any manners.
